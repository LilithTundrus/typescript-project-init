# Node Repo Init

A small script to assist with creating a new Node.js
repository. Simple, to the point and **not** needlessly written in JS


## Usage

Run this shell script like any other script.

First, modify the script to be executable: 

```shell
chmod +x initrepo.sh
```

Then, run the script:

```
./initrepo.sh
```

Follow the steps for NPM init after all files have been created and you're ready
to go!

## Using on Windows

As of 1.0.0, you can use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for Windows 2.11 and above to run this script like you would on any Linux or UNIX system
