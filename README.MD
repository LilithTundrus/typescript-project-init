# typescript-proj-init

A small script to assist with creating a new TypeScript
repository. Simple, to the point and **not** needlessly written in JS


## Usage

### Prerequisates

You will need `git` `tsc` and `npm` globally installed

Run this shell script like any other script.

### Running the script

First, modify the script to be executable: 

```shell
chmod +x initrepo-ts.sh
```

Then, run the script:

```
./initrepo-ts.sh
```

Follow the steps for NPM init after all files have been created and you're ready
to go!

## Using on Windows

You can use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for Windows 2.11 and above to run this script like you would on any Linux or UNIX system
